# MobilePay
Fee Calculation Service


## Description
Whenever a customer purchases a product using MobilePay, the merchants have to pay a small fee to MobilePay

Rules for fee calculation
- All merchants should be charged 1% of the transaction amount.
- Tesla should get 25% discount
- Rema1000 should get 15% discount
- McDonald should get 5% discount
- Transactions made during the weekend (Saturday & Sunday) are free.
- If a merchant has more than 10 transactions in 1 month, they get additional 20% volume discount

There is a transaction entity intended to store information about all merchant transactions in order to implement this assignment.
Transactions can be called single or multiple as you mentioned in the instruction.
Merchants and fee settings are dynamic and can be adjusted as needed. For calculating fees, I implemented two fetch models. 
1- Fetching all transactions and calculating fees in the application.(Set the CalculationMethod to false in FeeSetting config to use this method) 
2- Fetching based on weekdays, months, and years, and calculating the fee and discounts.(Default method - Set the CalculationMethod to true in FeeSetting config to use this method) 

This project implement with clean architecture and DDD approach.
Project Structure:
- MobilePay.Core.Domain: inculding aggregate root and all domain and common classes.
- MobilePay.Infrastructures.Data: repository, queries, and Db context by configuration of every entity.
- MobilePay.Core.ApplicationService: all services define at this layer. 
- Framework.Tools: all method and extention share between layers.
- MobilePay.Endpoints.WebApi: Endpoint API and app service configuration.
- Test: In this Project I covered most of important tests like `Unit Testing`, `Integration Testing` at separate projects based on the functionality

## Application Structure

In this application I used a [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) with using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library in my controllers for a clean and [thin controller](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/), also instead of using and injecting a `application service` class in our controller, we just inject a mediator class, because after some times our controller will depends to different services and this breaks single responsibility principle. 

Mediator mediate between objects and prevent direct coupling between objects, and objects could communicate each other with sending some message through mediator as a gateway. Here We use mediator pattern to manage the delivery of messages to handlers. For example in our controllers we create a command and send it to mediator and mediator will route our command to a specific command handler in application layer. 

One of the advantages behind the [mediator pattern](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) is that it allows us to define some pipelines of activities for requests on top of our mediator for doing some cross cutting concerns that brings [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) in our application.

For implementing these pipelines in our mediator to handle cross-cutting concerns we use MediatR libraries and its [Pipeline Behaviors](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) or we can create some [MediatR Decorators](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) as our pipelines.

Also in this project I used [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) or [Restructuring to a Vertical Slice Architecture](https://codeopinion.com/restructuring-to-a-vertical-slice-architecture/) also I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) in this project.

- We treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
- When We adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many different "layers" in an application. we are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice and each change affects only one slice. 
- We `Minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.
- With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects. For implementing vertical slice architecture using cqrs pattern is a good match.

Also here I used cqrs for decompose my features to very small parts that make our application

- maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- adding new feature to this mechanism is very easy without any breaking change in other part of our codes. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.
- easy to maintain and any changes only affect on one command or query (or a slice) and avoid any breaking changes on other parts
- it gives us better separation of concerns and cross cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines) in our code instead of a big service class for doing a lot of things.  

With using CQRS, our code will be more aligned with [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), especially with:

- [Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) rule - because logic responsible for a given operation is enclosed in its own type.
- [Open-Closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) rule - because to add new operation you donâ€™t need to edit any of the existing types, instead you need to add a new file with a new type representing that operation.

We cut each business functionality into some vertical slices, and inner each of this slices we have [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) specific to that feature (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, ...). In Our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods. 

## Installation
You can run the project by executing these commands from the root folder (where the .sln file is located):

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
For running with docker, the connection string must change to below:
```
"DatabaseConnection": "Data Source=sqlserver;Password=P@ssw0rd;Initial Catalog=MobilePay_DB;User ID=sa;Persist Security Info=true;"
```

You should be able to make requests to `localhost:8090` for the API project once these commands are complete.

## Documentation
* Swagger has been used to provide documentation for the object model. 
- [Online document](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5287501/UVXkmZuU)

## Test
- For every unit function implement unit test and all functionality tested.
- All of the API functionality tested by the Postman Integration test as well as webapi test.
